**Parsers** turn strings of characters into meaningful data structures (like a
JSON object!). **nearley** is a **fast**, **feature-rich**, and **modern**
parser toolkit for JavaScript. nearley is an [npm Staff
Pick](https://github.com/npm/npm-collection-staff-picks).

### nearley 101

1. Install: `$ npm install -g nearley` (or try nearley live in your browser
   [here](https://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground/)!)
2. Write your grammar:
   ```
   # Match a CSS color
   # http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#colorunits
   @builtin "whitespace.ne" # `_` means arbitrary amount of whitespace
   @builtin "number.ne"     # `int`, `decimal`, and `percentage` number primitives
   csscolor -> "#" hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit
             | "#" hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit
             | "rgb"  _ "(" _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ ")"
             | "hsl"  _ "(" _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ ")"
             | "rgba" _ "(" _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ "," _ decimal _ ")"
             | "hsla" _ "(" _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ "," _ colnum _ "," _ decimal _ ")"
   hexdigit -> [a-fA-F0-9]
   colnum   -> int | percentage
   ```
3. Compile your grammar:
   ```
   $ nearleyc csscolor.ne -o csscolor.js
   ```
4. Test your grammar:
   ```
   $ nearley-test -i "#00ff00" csscolor.js
   Parse results: 
   [ [ '#', [ '0' ], [ '0' ], [ 'f' ], [ 'f' ], [ '0' ], [ '0' ] ] ]
   ```
5. Turn your grammar into a generator:
   ```
   $ nearley-unparse -n 3 csscolor.js
   #Ab21F2
   rgb  ( -29.889%,7,8172)
   #a40
   ```
6. You try it! Type a CSS color here:
   <input type="text" id="parse-input" placeholder="rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5)" />
   <pre><code id="parse-output">…and the parsed output will appear here!</code></pre>
7. Create beautiful railroad diagrams to document your grammar formally.
   ```
   $ nearley-railroad csscolor.ne -o csscolor.html
   ```
   See a demo [here](/www/railroad-demo).

### Features

*  nearley is the first JS parser to use the **Earley** algorithm (insert your
   own ‘early bird’ pun here). It also implements Joop Leo's optimizations for
   right-recursion, making it effectively **linear-time** for LL(k) grammars.
*  nearley lives happily in **node**, but doesn't mind the **browser**.
*  nearley outputs **small** files. And its **expressive** DSL comes with
   plenty of **syntactic sugar** to keep your source files short. And sweet.
*  nearley's grammar language is powerful and expressive: you can use
   **macros**, import from a large **builtin library** of pre-defined
   parser-pieces, use a **tokenizer** for extra performance, and more!
*  nearley is built on an idiomatic **streaming API**. You even have access to
   partial parses to build **predictive** user interfaces.
*  nearley processes **left recursion** without choking. In fact, nearley will
   parse anything you throw at it without complaining or going into a ~~sulk~~
  infinite loop.
*  nearley handles **ambiguous grammars** gracefully. Ambiguous grammars can
   be parsed in multiple ways: instead of getting confused, nearley gives you
   all the parsings (in a deterministic order!).
*  nearley allows for debugging with generous **error detection**. When it
   catches a parse-time error, nearley tells you exactly what went wrong and
   where.
*  nearley is powerful enough to be **bootstrapped**. That means nearley uses
   nearley to compile parts of nearley. _nearleyception!_
*  nearley parsers can be inverted to form **generators** which output random
   strings that match a grammar. Useful for writing **test cases**,
   **fuzzers**, and **Mad-Libs**.
*  You can export nearley parsers as **railroad diagrams**, which provide
   easy-to-understand documentation of your grammar.
*  nearley comes with fantastic tooling. You can find editor plug-ins for
   **vim**, **Sublime Text**, **Atom**, and **VS Code**; there are also
   plug-ins for **Webpack** and **gulp**.
